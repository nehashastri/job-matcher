# Test Use Cases

This file is now a redirect to the single source of truth for test scenarios.

- The full, approved test catalog lives inside [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) under each phase (Phase 5=matching/storage, Phase 6=networking, Phase 7=email).
- Add, edit, or review tests there to avoid duplication and drift. Tests are the only place where phase numbers appear; production code stays feature-based.
- If you need a checklist, derive it from the implementation plan rather than recreating it here. Storage is now Excel-only (.xlsx) and resumes use `data/resume.docx` by default.
