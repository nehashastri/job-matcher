# Test Use Cases

This file is now a redirect to the single source of truth for test scenarios.

- The full, approved test catalog lives inside [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) under each phase.
- Add, edit, or review tests there to avoid duplication and drift.
- If you need a checklist, derive it from the implementation plan rather than recreating it here.
