Evaluate the attached resume against the provided Job Description using the following preferences, hard filters, and scoring rules.

PRIMARY GOAL
- Assess how well the role aligns with application-layer AI and product-focused ML engineering work, not infrastructure, IT operations, or enterprise support.

YES LIST (High Match Signals)
- Strongly reward roles that involve:
- Application-layer AI: building RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, LLM-powered automation, copilots, or AI-driven features.
- Product ML: experimentation, A/B testing, causal inference, personalization, customer segmentation, or data-informed product decisions.
- End-to-end software development: building functional applications or APIs (FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit, React + backend) rather than isolated scripts.
- High-level ML usage: fine-tuning or applying models using frameworks like HuggingFace, PyTorch, or managed ML services, without requiring low-level CUDA, kernel development, or heavy mathematical proofs.
- Clear ownership of AI features used by customers or internal products.

HARD REJECTION & SCORE CAPS (Apply Before Any Positive Scoring)
- IT / Systems / MSP / Enterprise Support (Automatic Rejection)
If the role primarily involves IT support, systems engineering, systems administration, desktop support, MSP environments, ticketing systems, Active Directory, Microsoft 365 administration, networking, cybersecurity operations, hardware handling, or end-user support: Score ≤ 1.5 regardless of technical complexity.
- Enterprise / Process Systems (Hard Filter)
MES, QMS, PLM, manufacturing execution, governance, audits, compliance, training users, internal process tooling: Score ≤ 3.0.
- Forensics / Legal / Reverse Engineering (Hard Filter)
Litigation support, software originality analysis, legal documentation, reverse engineering, forensic analysis: Score ≤ 3.0.
- Infra-Heavy / On-Call Roles
On-call rotations, postmortems, reliability engineering, cluster management, DevOps-first roles: Cap score at ≤ 5.0.
- Hardware / Networking
Embedded systems, firmware, robotics, signal processing, OSI/TCP-IP, networking, GPU/cluster infrastructure, physical systems: Strong penalty or rejection.
- Heavy SQL / Reporting
ETL-centric roles, BI dashboards, Tableau, Looker, manual reporting, analytics without ML modeling: Penalize heavily.
- Poor Work-Life Balance Signals
Consulting firms, MSPs, hedge funds, high-pressure finance, manufacturing operations, litigation-driven environments: Cap score at ≤ 5.0.

AI PRESENCE GATE (CRITICAL)
If the job description does NOT explicitly mention at least one of the following:

AI, ML, LLMs, models, experimentation, data-driven decision making, or machine learning workflows
Then:

Cap the score at 4.0 regardless of software quality or seniority.

SCORING & SPONSORSHIP RULES

Candidate status: Candidate is on an F1 Visa with OPT. Do NOT reject solely due to sponsorship unless the job explicitly states sponsorship is not allowed.

Scoring: Return a float score from 0.0 to 10.0. A high score means the role is focused on building software-based AI applications and strongly fits the candidate’s strengths.

Output format: Return JSON only in the following structure:

{
"score": number,
"reason": string,
"title": string,
"company": string
}

Focus the reasoning on alignment or misalignment with application-layer AI, product ML, and end-to-end AI software development.
