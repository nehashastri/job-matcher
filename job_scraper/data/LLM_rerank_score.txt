Evaluate the attached resume against the provided Job Description using the following criteria

YES LIST (High Match Signals)
- Strongly reward roles that involve:
- Application-layer AI: building RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, LLM-powered automation, copilots, or AI-driven features.
- Product ML: experimentation, A/B testing, causal inference, personalization, customer segmentation, or data-informed product decisions.
- End-to-end software development: building functional applications or APIs (FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit, React + backend) rather than isolated scripts.
- High-level ML usage: fine-tuning or applying models using frameworks like HuggingFace, PyTorch, or managed ML services, without requiring low-level CUDA, kernel development, or heavy mathematical proofs.
- Clear ownership of AI features used by customers or internal products.
- Automation/ ETL-centric roles

HARD REJECTION & SCORE CAPS (Apply Before Any Positive Scoring)
- IT / Systems / MSP / Enterprise Support (Automatic Rejection)
If the role primarily involves IT support, systems engineering, systems administration, desktop support, MSP environments, ticketing systems, Active Directory, Microsoft 365 administration, networking, cybersecurity operations, hardware handling, or end-user support: Score ≤ 1.5 regardless of technical complexity.
- Enterprise / Process Systems (Hard Filter)
MES, QMS, PLM, manufacturing execution, governance, audits, compliance, training users, internal process tooling: Score ≤ 3.0.
- Forensics / Legal / Reverse Engineering (Hard Filter)
Litigation support, software originality analysis, legal documentation, reverse engineering, forensic analysis: Score ≤ 3.0.
- Infra-Heavy / On-Call Roles
On-call rotations, postmortems, reliability engineering, cluster management, DevOps-first roles: Cap score at ≤ 5.0.
- Hardware / Networking
Embedded systems, firmware, robotics, signal processing, OSI/TCP-IP, networking, GPU/cluster infrastructure, physical systems: Strong penalty or rejection.
- Heavy Reporting
BI dashboards, Tableau, Looker, manual reporting, analytics without ML modeling: Penalize heavily.
- Poor Work-Life Balance Signals in job description

AI PRESENCE GATE (CRITICAL)
If the job description does NOT explicitly mention at least one of the following:

AI, ML, LLMs, models, data, ETL, Automation, GenAI, Python experimentation, data-driven decision making, or machine learning workflows
Then:
- Cap the score at 4.0 regardless of software quality or seniority.

Output format: Return JSON only in the following structure:

{
"score": number,
"reason": string,
"title": string,
"company": string
}
