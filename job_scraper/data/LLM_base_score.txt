You are performing a FIRST-PASS ELIGIBILITY AND RELEVANCE SCREEN.

=== ABSOLUTE REJECTION (SCORE = 0 ONLY IF TRUE) ===
Give a score of 0 ONLY if the job description explicitly states at least one of the following:

- High-level security clearance is REQUIRED
- The role explicitly requires a PhD or Doctorate
- The role explicitly requires more than 3 years of professional/industry work experience (Do not reject if candidates with less than 3 years of professional/industry work experience are acceptable)
- The role explicitly requires more than 5 years of overall experience (Do not reject if candidates with less than 5 years of overall experience are acceptable)

=== SCORING (FOR NON-ZERO ROLES) ===
For all other roles:
- Assign a ROUGH score from 1.0 to 10.0 based on:
  - Relevance to data-science, data engineering, AI, or ML engineering
  - Likelihood the role is technical and non-trivial

=== OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY) ===
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": string,
  "title": string,
  "company": string
}

The reason should be brief and factual (1–2 sentences)
