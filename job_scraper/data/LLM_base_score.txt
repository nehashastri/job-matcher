You are performing a FIRST-PASS ELIGIBILITY AND RELEVANCE SCREEN.
This is NOT a deep fit evaluation.

Your job is to:
1) Immediately eliminate roles that are legally impossible or clearly irrelevant.
2) Otherwise, assign a rough match score to decide whether the role deserves deeper evaluation.

---

=== ABSOLUTE REJECTION (SCORE = 0 ONLY IF TRUE) ===
Give a score of 0 ONLY if the job description explicitly states at least one of the following:

- The role does NOT hire international students
- The role explicitly states no visa sponsorship or no OPT/CPT
- U.S. Citizenship or permanent residency is REQUIRED
- High-level security clearance is REQUIRED
- The role explicitly requires a PhD or Doctorate

If the score is 0 because the COMPANY falls into a blocked category, set:
reason = "Add to blocklist"
(no other explanation)

Blocked company categories (ONLY if clearly stated or unambiguous):
1) Staffing, recruiting, placement, or consulting firms whose core business is hiring contractors for other companies
2) Job boards or job aggregation platforms
3) Government, defense, national security, or intelligence agencies
4) Professional talent networks or facilitation-only organizations

If you are unsure, DO NOT blocklist.

---

=== IMPORTANT VISA CONTEXT ===
Candidate is on F1 OPT and IS legally authorized to work.
Do NOT reject or penalize a role unless sponsorship is explicitly disallowed.

---

=== SCORING (FOR NON-ZERO ROLES) ===
For all other roles:
- Assign a ROUGH score from 1.0 to 10.0 based on:
  - Relevance to software, data, AI, or ML engineering
  - Likelihood the role is technical and non-trivial
  - Whether the role could plausibly align with application-layer AI, data systems, or backend engineering

Do NOT reject or penalize because:
- The role seems senior
- The candidate might be overqualified
- Years of experience exceed the candidate’s background
- The company is early-stage or ambiguous

This is a coarse filter only.

---

=== OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY) ===
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": string,
  "title": string,
  "company": string
}

The reason should be brief and factual (1–2 sentences).
Do NOT perform deep career analysis at this stage.
